Elicit is an AI tool to find 'seed articles' to mine for keywords/subject headings.  When you enter a question, it returns alternate questions that can lead to further "seed" articles.

Here are some key characteristics and features of Elicit:

1. **Automate Research:** Elicit uses language models to help you automate research workflows, like parts of literature review.

2. **Locate Key Information:** Elicit can find relevant papers without perfect keyword match, summarize takeaways from the paper specific to your question, and extract key information from the papers.

3. **Assist With Other Facets Of Research:** While answering questions with research is the main focus of Elicit, there are also other research tasks that help with brainstorming, summarization, and text classification.

4. **Transfer Work:** You can save and export your work to citation managers such as Zotero.
